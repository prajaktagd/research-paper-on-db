- Selecting Database - An art to know
- Art of choosing a  database

## Abstract 

-  The new generation of applications like Business Intelligence, data warehouses, Social networking etc. requires processing of terabytes or petabytes of data. This is achieved by distributed processing. This is the major reason for the power of web companies such as Google, Amazon, and Salesforce etc. In this case, relational databases are found to be inadequate in distributed processing involving very large number of servers and handling big data applications. The systems like columnar database have attempted to address the problems in storing information using traditional database system. The database system design should be chosen to handle large pool of data to get analytical performance. The present study focuses on identifying the problems in the relational database system and highlighting the benefits gained by usage of columnar database system in area of business intelligence or data warehouse systems.

- In recent years, new businesses opportunities have sparked the market for new types of databases and
more and more companies strongly consider acquiring them. Still, however, there are many companies
that use file-based, hierarchical, network and relational databases and they have no intention of
transferring to some other database type. Many of them do so because of fear that promises of the new
database trends may cost more than they taste. Companies may not always be aware of all the risks
and problems they may encounter while transferring to a new database. Neither do they have any
standard process support guiding them in this risky endeavor. Right now, there is no process model
guiding organizations in a database selection process.

## Conclusion

- Selecting the perfect database requires a comprehensive evaluation of multiple factors, as you saw. Remember, each project is different. And the ideal database choice may vary based on specific requirements. So take the time to thoroughly assess each consideration, and seek expert advice if needed.
With the right database powering your project, youâ€™ll lay a solid foundation for success and will unlock the full potential of your data-driven application.

- A lot of people think that choosing a database is basically choosing between SQL and no SQL, this is incorrect. The most important factors are to consider the structure of your data, the size of your database, the speed you need to access your data, as well as the scaling of your database.
