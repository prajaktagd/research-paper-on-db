# Database Security

Security of databases refers to the array of controls, tools, and procedures designed to ensure and safeguard confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility. Security of databases is a complicated and challenging task that requires all aspects of security practices and technologies. The more usable and accessible the database is, the more susceptible we are to threats from security. The more vulnerable it is to attacks and threats, the more difficult it is to access and utilize.

## Why Database Security is Important?

The amount of damage an incident like a data breach can cause our business is contingent on various consequences or elements.

- **Intellectual property that is compromised :** If our intellectual property has been stolen or disclosed and our competitive advantage is lost, it could be difficult to keep or recover.

- **The damage to our brand's reputation :** Customers or partners may not want to purchase goods or services from us, if they do not feel they can trust our company to protect their data or their own.

- **The concept of business continuity :** Some businesses cannot continue to function until a breach has been resolved.

- **Penalties or fines to be paid for not complying :** The cost of not complying with international regulations like the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SAO) or Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) specific to industry regulations on data privacy, like HIPAA or regional privacy laws like the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) could be a major problem with fines in worst cases in excess of many million dollars for each violation.

- **Costs for repairing breaches and notifying consumers about them :** Alongside notifying customers of a breach, the company that has been breached is required to cover the investigation and forensic services such as crisis management, triage repairs to the affected systems, and much more. 

## Common Threats and Challenges

**Insider Dangers :** An insider threat can be an attack on security from any three sources having an access privilege to the database.

**Human Error :** The unintentional mistakes, weak passwords or sharing passwords, and other negligent or uninformed behaviors of users remain the root causes of almost half of all data security breaches.


**Exploitation of Database Software Vulnerabilities :** Hackers earn their money by identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in software such as databases management software.

**SQL/NoSQL Injection Attacks :** A specific threat to databases is the infusing of untrue SQL as well as other non-SQL string attacks in queries for databases delivered by web-based apps and HTTP headers.


**Buffer Overflow Attacks :** Buffer overflow happens when a program seeks to copy more data into the memory block with a certain length than it can accommodate.


**Denial of service (DoS/DDoS) attacks :** In a denial of service (DoS) attack, the attacker deluges the target server—in this case the database server—with so many requests that the server can no longer fulfill legitimate requests from actual users, and, in many cases, the server becomes unstable or crashes.

## Best practices

**Physical security :** Whether your database server is on-premise or in a cloud data center, it must be located within a secure, climate-controlled environment.

**Administrative and network access controls :** The practical minimum number of users should have access to the database, and their permissions should be restricted to the minimum levels necessary for them to do their jobs.

**End user account/device security :** Always be aware of who is accessing the database and when and how the data is being used.

**Encryption :** ALL data—including data in the database, and credential data—should be protected with best-in-class encryption while at rest and in transit.

**Database software security :** Always use the latest version of your database management software, and apply all patches as soon as they are issued.

**Application/web server security :** Any application or web server that interacts with the database can be a channel for attack and should be subject to ongoing security testing and best practice management.

**Backup security :** All backups, copies, or images of the database must be subject to the same security controls as the database itself.

**Auditing :** Record all logins to the database server and operating system, and log all operations performed on sensitive data as well.
