# What is a database?

A database is an organized collection of structured information or data that is stored and managed in a computer system. It is designed to efficiently store, retrieve, and manipulate large amounts of data. It allows users and applications to access and work, while ensuring data integrity, consistency, and security. Databases are used in various domains and industries to store different types of data, such as customer information, financial records, inventory data, scientific data, and more.

Databases are managed by database management systems (DBMS), which provide the tools and functionality to create, modify, and retrieve data from the database. Common types of DBMS include relational database management systems (RDBMS) like MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server, as well as non-relational or NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Cassandra.

# Evolution of database

The database started with a file-based system about 50 years ago. In the due time, it has gone through generations of evolution.

- Databases were first introduced in 1968 as flat-file-based databases.
- Then the Hierarchical Database came into existence and lasted until 1980. IBMâ€™s first database, IMS (Information Management System) was based on this.
- Charles Bachman developed the first Network data model, called Integrated Data Store (IDS). It was introduced in the early 1960s and standardized in 1971.
- In 1970, the Relational Database was introduced.
- Today, it is the era of Relational Database and Database Management.
