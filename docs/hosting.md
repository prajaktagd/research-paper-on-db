# Hosting

Database hosting is providing, a managed server that is optimized for running a database. A host can run a web server, mail server, file share, or other file-based application. Databases are different in that they demand specific hardware and software configurations to support the database.
  - A database host must optimize I/O for the specific database and storage platform. A database hosting provider should consider configuration of RAID levels, volumes, and file layout for optimal performance, growth, and internal resiliency.

  - A database host must run certified versions of certified operating systems to ensure your database support licenses are valid. A database hosting provider would not attempt to upgrade an operating system to an unsupported version.

  - Databases also have particular backup requirements. Database hosting providers should be able to help you design a specific backup plan for your database and host based on your recovery requirements.

  - Few of the database host providers are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), etc.
