# The history of databases

The history of databases dates back several decades. Here is a brief overview of the major milestones, key contributors and developers associated with each database model:

1. Hierarchical and Network Models (1960s-1970s):

   - In the 1960s, the hierarchical model was introduced, where data is organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships.
   - In the 1970s, the network model emerged, allowing more complex relationships between data entities.
   - Charles Bachman is credited with the development of the first database management system (DBMS) based on the hierarchical model, known as the Integrated Data Store (IDS) in the early 1960s.
   - IBM's Information Management System (IMS), developed by a team led by Ted Codd and Donald D. Chamberlin, introduced the hierarchical model in commercial database systems.
   - The network model was developed by Charles Bachman and the team at General Electric in the late 1960s, leading to the development of the first network DBMS called Integrated Data Store (IDS).

2. Relational Model (1970s):

   - Edgar F. Codd proposed the relational model in 1970, which revolutionized the database industry.
   - The relational model organizes data into tables (relations) with rows (tuples) and columns (attributes), and enforces relationships through keys.
   - IBM's System R and Oracle's Oracle Database were among the early implementations of relational databases.
   - Edgar F. Codd is widely regarded as the father of the relational model. In 1970, Codd published a groundbreaking paper titled "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks," introducing the theoretical foundations of the relational model.
   - IBM's System R project, led by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce, developed one of the earliest practical implementations of a relational database system.

3. SQL (1970s-1980s):

   - Structured Query Language (SQL) was developed in the 1970s as a standard language for interacting with relational databases.
   - SQL enabled users to define, manipulate, and query data using a declarative syntax, making it easier to work with relational databases.
   - SQL (Structured Query Language) was developed by a team led by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce at IBM in the 1970s.
   - Oracle Corporation, founded by Larry Ellison, Bob Miner, and Ed Oates, played a significant role in popularizing SQL and developing commercial relational database systems that supported SQL as the standard language.

4. Commercial Database Systems (1980s):

   - In the 1980s, commercial database systems gained popularity, including Oracle Database, IBM DB2, and Microsoft SQL Server.
   - These systems offered improved scalability, performance, and reliability for enterprise-level applications.

5. Object-Oriented Databases (1980s-1990s):

   - Object-oriented databases emerged as an alternative to relational databases, providing better support for complex data structures and inheritance.
   - However, they faced challenges with standardization and compatibility, and their adoption remained limited.
   - The concept of object-oriented databases emerged from the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm.
   - Michael Stonebraker, one of the pioneers of database research, played a key role in the development of object-oriented databases.
   - Various researchers and companies, including GemStone Systems, Objectivity, and Versant Corporation, developed object-oriented database management systems (OODBMS) based on different approaches.

6. NoSQL and Big Data (2000s-Present):

   - With the rise of web applications and the need to handle large volumes of unstructured data, NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases gained prominence.
   - NoSQL databases provide scalability, flexibility, and high-performance for non-relational data models, such as key-value stores, document databases, columnar databases, and graph databases.
   - The advent of big data technologies, such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark, revolutionized the handling and analysis of massive datasets.
   - NoSQL databases were developed by various individuals and organizations, each contributing to different types of NoSQL databases.
   - Notable contributors and organizations include Amazon (DynamoDB), Apache Cassandra (originally developed at Facebook), MongoDB, Redis (Salvatore Sanfilippo), and Couchbase (based on Apache CouchDB).

7. New Trends and Technologies:
   - New trends in databases include NewSQL databases, which aim to combine the scalability of NoSQL with the ACID properties of traditional relational databases.
   - Cloud databases, such as Amazon Web Services' Amazon Aurora and Google Cloud's Cloud Spanner, offer highly scalable and managed database services in the cloud.
   - Blockchain technology introduced distributed databases with immutable and transparent transaction records.
   - NewSQL databases were developed by different companies and research groups, aiming to combine the scalability of NoSQL with the ACID properties of traditional relational databases.
   - Companies such as VoltDB, Google (Spanner), and Cockroach Labs (CockroachDB) have been involved in the development of NewSQL databases.
   - The development of blockchain technology involves contributions from individuals and organizations such as Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin), Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum), and various open-source blockchain frameworks like Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum.

The database landscape continues to evolve, with ongoing advancements in areas such as distributed databases, in-memory databases, graph databases, and data management for AI and machine learning applications.

It's important to note that database development is a collaborative effort involving contributions from numerous researchers, engineers, and organizations. The list provided highlights some key figures and contributions in the development of different database models, but there are many more individuals and teams who have made significant contributions to the field.
