# Effect on Environment 

To store, process and transfer data, a server needs a lot of electricity and water. These tasks constitute only half of its actually energy consumption: nearly 50% of the electricity is used to cool the servers.

Followings are the links between data center and climate change.

- Data centers use nearly 3% of the world's electricity consumption.
- Data centers account for 2% of total greenhouse gas emissions.
- Data centers are responsible for 15% of the IT sector's carbon footprint and 18% of the digital pollution.
- In 2018, it was estimated that the carbon footprint of data centers was equivalent to the entire aviation - industry! 
- Some of the largest data centers can contain hundreds of thousands of servers and IT devices using more than - 100 megawatts. That's what 80,000 American homes consume in electricity.
- To cool its 800 data centers, California alone uses the equivalent of 158,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools per year to cool its servers. The water used by the data centers is mostly discharged directly into the sewer - system, causing damage to the environment, the economy and the population.
- Per year, the water used by a medium-sized data center is equivalent to that of three hospitals!
- In 2016 (that was 7 years ago!), it was calculated that, data centers consumed globally more electricity than Great Britain alone (416.2 vs 300 TWh).
