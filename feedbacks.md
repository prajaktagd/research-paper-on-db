1. Refine the outline of the research paper
2. Consider more criteria for choosing the database
   - [x] Cost
   - [x] Concurrency
   - [x] Load
   - [x] Security (encryption)
   - [x] Data localization effects
   - [x] API compatibility (Document DB, MongoDB)
   - [x] Integration with outside data; for example from Kafka streams
   - [ ] Host and providers
   - [ ] Learning curve
   - [ ] Replication
   - [ ] Read only DB
   - [ ] Effect to the Environment (carbon footprint)
3. Background about database (What is the need?)
