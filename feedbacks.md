1. Refine the outline of the research paper
2. Consider more criteria for choosing the database
   - Cost
   - Concurrency
   - Load
   - Learning curve
   - Security (encryption)
   - Data localization effects
   - Host and providers
   - Replication
   - API compatibility (Document DB, MongoDB)
   - Read only DB
   - Integration with outside data; for example from Kafka streams
   - Effect to the Environment (carbon footprint)
3. Background about database (What is the need?)
